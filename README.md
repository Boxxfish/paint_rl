[x] Create agent with random policy for testing.
[x] Get benchmarking set up with realistic training times.
[x] Add real time plotting functionality.

Second pass (Get agent working on environment):
[x] Get model exporting working.
[x] Set up model in copy stroke environment for single env.
[x] Upgrade to batch mode.
[x] Check if cuda makes a difference in training speed.
[x] Add CLI parsing for hyperparameters and fix environments not reloading correctly.
[x] Add monitor.
[] Hyperparameter search integration.
[] Switch to PPO.
[] Iterate until model gives satisfactory results.
